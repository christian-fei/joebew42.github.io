### Addressing stakeholders

It was likely that the stakeholders would be affected by the Kanban
implementation as well. However the changes would be for the better
- it meant the team would start saying “no” to work they couldn’t
complete, start standing up for quality and removing low-priority
items from the team’s backlog. Despite this, having a discussion
before is always a good idea.

### Constructing the first board

A good way to start the construction of a Kanban board is by doing
value-stream map. It's basically a visualization of the value chain
and provides insight into work states, flow and time through the
system (cycle time).

### Trying to build a Kanban board

Common questions that emerged during the discussion

* What types of work do we have?
* Who handles it?
* Should we share responsibility across different work types?

  "Should we let one fixed part of the team deal with the direct
   questions (reactive work) and let the rest of the team focus
   on the projects (proactive work)?"

* How do we deal with shared responsibility given specialized skills?

### A first Kanban board (an example)


              |  BACKLOG  |  READY FOR WIP  |  WIP  |  DONE  |
--------------|-----------|-----------------|-------|--------|
Support       |           |                 |       |        |
              |           |                 |       |  X     |
--------------|-----------|-----------------|-------|--------|
Daily duties  |           |                 |       |        |
              |           |     X           |       |        |
--------------|-----------|-----------------|-------|--------|
Project A     |    X      |                 |  X    |        |
              |    X      |                 |   X   |        |
--------------|-----------|-----------------|-------|--------|
Project B     |           |     X           |       |        |
              |           |                 |       |        |

As you can see the "WIP" is limited to only 2 activities

### Setting the first Work In Progress (WIP) limit

The first WIP limit we used was 2n-1. (n= number of team members, -1
to encourage cooperation). Why? Simple, we had no better idea J. Also
it seemed uncontroversial to start off with. The formula provided a
simple and logical explanation to anyone trying to push work onto the
team: "... so given that each team member can work on at most two things
at the same time, one active and one waiting, why would you expect them
to take on more?" Looking back, any generous limit would have worked for
starters. By monitoring the Kanban board it is easy to figure out the
right limits along the way.
