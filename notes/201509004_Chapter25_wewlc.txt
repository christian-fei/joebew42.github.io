# Dependency-Breaking Techniques

Here we are going to expose some refactoring techniques that helps us
to extract and test dependencies out from our code.

These techniques are good to get methods, classes, and clusters of
classes under test, to make the system more maintainable.
At that point, we can use test-supported refactorings to make the
design cleaner.

In general, these are the main steps to execute for each technique:

1. Extract code
2. Write tests
3. Refactor

> Remember: When we are writing tests for existing code we want to
> document what the software actually does and *NOT* what is supposed
> to do.
