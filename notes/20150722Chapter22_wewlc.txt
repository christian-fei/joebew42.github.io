- *Bulleted Methods*

  A bulleted method is a method with nearly no indentation. It is just
  a sequence of code chunks that reminds you of a bulleted list. Some
  of the code in the chunks might be indented, but the method itself
  isn't dominated by indentation.

  Just try to extract sections as method. That is not always an easy
  way, because sometime a temporary variable used in a section is also
  used in another section.
