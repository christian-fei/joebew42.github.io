### How to get started with Kanban

- Taking a snapshot of the actual process
- Do a retrospective

- Visualize the workflow
- Trying to limit the WIP
- Trying to add some buffers and swith to a pull system, instead of push
-- Buffers helps you to improve process and understand how to set the right
   WIP that allows you to streamline the process, reduce bottlenecks
- Adapt your process
-- Change WIPs
-- rebuild the workflow

Doing practice, learn from failures, improve the process!
