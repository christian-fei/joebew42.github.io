I decided to stop my studies/practices on Phoenix Framework due few
reasons:

- Primary reason: I have not a good knowledge on Elixir Language, I
  prefer to keep focus on studying Erlang first.

- Secondary reason: The Phoenix Framework itself is not yet mature as
  other frameworks are, there is still work that have to be done in
  order to make this framework usable for production use. At the
  moment there are not so much information all around the Internet
  about usages and real life examples of this framework. Community
  around this project must grow.
