There are 5 core properties to a Kanban implementation

1. Limit Work-in-Progress
   limit the overall work that can be done in parallel for each process phase
2. Visualize Workflow
   that means give a visual representation of the work process, highlighting for each phase of the process, the outcame value.
3. Measure & Optimize Flow
   find a way to measure every actions
4. Make Process Policies Explicit
5. Manage Quantitatively

There at least 5 emergent properties we might expect in a Kanban implementation

1. Prioritize Work by Cost of Delay
2. Optimize Value with Classes of Service
3. Spread Risk with Capacity Allocation
4. Encourage Process Innovation
5. Use Models to Recognize Improvement Opportunities
