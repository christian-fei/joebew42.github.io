# Seeing Responsabilities and extract them

## Ask to ourself some question:

 - Why is this method here?
 - What is it doing for the class?

## Some heuristics

We are going to discover what is already there. Regardless of what
structure legacy code has, its piece do **identiable things**

### 1. Group Methods

Look for similar method names. Write down all of the methods on a class,
along with their access types (public, private, and so on), and try to find
ones that seem to go together.

Method grouping is a great team exercise also. Put up poster boards in your team
room with lists of the method names for each of your major classes. Team members
can mark up the posters over time, showing different groupings of methods.
The whole team can hash out which groupings are better and decide on directions
for the code to go in.
